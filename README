Current Lua code version: 5.3

Things to consider when using the API:
  Objects created by the API, its lifetime should be managed based on the lifetime of the Lua State or the API module.
  If using custom memory management for the API, make sure that every API objects liftime should be based on the memory management lifetime (if provided by C++ class).

NOTE for Lua code:
  Since there are some modifications to the original Lua code for this C++ API, things to consider when changing to new Lua code/version;
  - Changes to lua_lock and lua_unlock to use C++ API multithreading code for synchronization.
  - Minor changes to Lua API functions (some are excluded, functions that uses two stacks like transferring data between state's stack (lua_xmove)) to use macro for swapping state to thread dependent state (removing possibility for multiple threads accessing one stack).
